üìÑ Project Description:
E-Lawyer is an online platform designed to bridge the gap between clients and legal professionals by offering a streamlined solution for legal consultations, appointments, document exchange, and real-time communication. The system allows clients to easily search for lawyers based on specialization, location, or availability and book appointments for legal advice.

Lawyers can manage appointments, accept or reject requests, chat with clients in real time, and even conduct video calls for consultations. The system also includes a secure messaging interface, case history tracking, and a payment module for booking fees or services.

The admin panel manages user registrations, lawyer verifications, feedback, and reports. This project combines Django, WebSockets (for real-time chat), and WebRTC (for video calls) to offer a full-stack legal service solution.
